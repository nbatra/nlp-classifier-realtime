A **foundation-level ML pipeline** for **programmatic advertising** that classifies website domains into **IAB Content Taxonomy v2.2** categories (~700 categories) using **NLP text classification** and generates high-value **audience segments** from **real-time bidstream** data. Built with **TF-IDF**, **multi-label classification** (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, SGD), **exponential time-decay scoring**, and a **two-tier real-time inference** architecture designed for AdTech-scale traffic. This notebook serves as a **foundation that can be extended into a production system** -- the architecture, algorithms, and scoring logic are production-proven, while the synthetic data and local execution environment would be replaced with real data sources and distributed infrastructure for deployment.

> **Production lineage:** The core architecture and scoring methodology in this project were designed and deployed at a real **AdTech company** by the author and an amazing engineering team. The model was deployed to calculate user interests in real time on bidstreams running at **8 million QPS**, enabled the company to detect intent and win bids earlier than competitors, and drove a fundamental shift in the **KV-store** data storage approach -- from materialized segment memberships to compact probability vectors, reducing storage footprint by 3-8x. This repository is a clean-room reimplementation with synthetic data for educational and portfolio purposes -- the pipeline design, two-tier lookup strategy, decay math, and segment economics are all drawn from that production system.

## Problem Statement

In **programmatic advertising**, every time someone loads a webpage, a **real-time bidding (RTB)** auction decides which ad to show -- in under 100ms. **Demand-Side Platforms (DSPs)** and advertisers pay premiums to reach users whose browsing behavior signals genuine interest. The challenge: **how do you classify 200K+ domains into ~700 IAB categories, track 500M+ users in real time, and assign audience segments -- all within a 10ms latency budget per bid request?**

This system solves that by decomposing the problem into four interconnected components of an **AdTech ML pipeline**:

| Component | What It Does | Timescale |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain Classification** | Multi-label NLP classification of website content into IAB categories | Batch (daily) |
| **Real-Time User Scoring** | Accumulate per-user IAB probability vectors from bidstream events | Streaming (sub-ms/event at 8M QPS) |
| **Temporal Decay** | Exponential time-decay with category-specific half-lives | Applied at read-time |
| **Segment Generation** | Threshold + top-K assignment to named audience segments | Periodic (hourly) |

---

## Why This Matters Commercially

- **2-5x CPM premiums** for well-classified audience segments vs. untargeted inventory
- A Travel advertiser pays significantly more to reach users reliably classified into "IAB-20: Travel" than to show ads to a random audience
- **Probability vector storage** (our approach) uses **3-8x less KV-store memory** than traditional materialized segment stores -- ~600 bytes/user compressed vs. 5-20 KB/user
- **Real-time intent detection** spots user interest **hours to a full day before** competitors relying on batch-refreshed segment lists, winning impressions at lower clearing prices

## Pipeline Overview

### `IAB_bidstream_user_classification.ipynb`

The complete end-to-end pipeline in a single notebook (50 cells) covering every step:

**Part 1 -- Domain Classification**
1. **Synthetic corpus generation** -- 500 domains across 23 IAB Tier-1 categories with realistic, category-specific vocabulary pools (production: replace with web crawler output)
2. **TF-IDF vectorization** -- 20,000 features, unigrams + bigrams, sublinear TF scaling, with a worked example showing exact term-weight calculations
3. **Model comparison** -- 4 classifiers evaluated via stratified 5-fold cross-validation:
   - Logistic Regression (OneVsRest)
   - **SGD Classifier (log loss + L2)** -- winner by macro F1
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
4. **Full-data model training** -- Best performer (SGD) trained on full data with CalibratedClassifierCV for probability output
5. **Domain lookup table** -- Pre-computed `{domain → {IAB_category: probability}}` mapping

**Part 2 -- Scoring, Segments & Evaluation**
6. **Bidstream simulation** -- 100,000 events across 5,000 users with power-law activity distributions, diurnal traffic patterns, and ~5% unknown domains
7. **Two-tier real-time scoring** -- Tier 1 (lookup table, <1ms) with Tier 2 fallback (live TF-IDF inference via `RealTimeClassifier` with in-memory caching for unknown domains)
8. **Exponential time-decay** -- Category-specific half-lives reflecting real-world intent persistence
9. **Audience segment generation** -- Top-K thresholded assignment to named segments with size and confidence analysis
10. **User journey trace** -- End-to-end walkthrough of a single user's path from raw bid events through scoring, decay, and final segment assignment
11. **Quality metrics** -- Segment coverage, user distribution, score density analysis, and threshold sensitivity curves
12. **Model interpretability** -- TF-IDF feature importance showing which terms drive each IAB category prediction

## Key Results & Visualizations

The pipeline generates 9 diagnostic plots covering every stage of the system:

| Plot | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| ![Domain Corpus Overview](plots/01_domain_corpus_overview.png) | Category distribution across the domain corpus -- monitors for class imbalance that degrades classifier performance |
| ![TF-IDF Worked Example](plots/02_tfidf_worked_example.png) | Exact term weights for a single domain -- the debugging view when a domain is misclassified |
| ![Model Comparison](plots/03_model_comparison.png) | 4-model head-to-head on F1, AUC, training time, and inference latency -- the model selection gate |
| ![Confusion Matrix](plots/04_confusion_matrix.png) | Per-category precision/recall heatmap -- identifies which IAB categories the classifier confuses |
| ![Bidstream Patterns](plots/05_bidstream_patterns.png) | Simulated traffic with diurnal and power-law patterns -- mirrors real-world monitoring dashboards |
| ![Decay Curves](plots/06_decay_curves.png) | How category-specific half-lives shape score retention -- the key business insight for segment freshness |
| ![Audience Segments](plots/07_audience_segments.png) | Segment size distribution and score density -- are segments large enough for programmatic scale? |
| ![Threshold Analysis](plots/08_threshold_analysis.png) | Precision vs. coverage trade-off at different confidence thresholds -- the tuning knob for segment quality |
| ![Feature Importance](plots/09_feature_importance.png) | Top TF-IDF features per IAB category -- interpretability for stakeholder buy-in and debugging |

---

## Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Text Vectorization** | TF-IDF (scikit-learn) | 50x cheaper than BERT with only 2-3% accuracy gap; no GPU required; interpretable feature weights |
| **Classification** | Calibrated SGD Classifier (OneVsRest, log loss + L2) | Best cross-validated F1 (0.93); well-calibrated via Platt scaling; sub-millisecond inference; industry standard in AdTech |
| **Model Comparison** | Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, SGD | All four evaluated; SGD wins on macro F1 with competitive AUC and fast training |
| **Bidstream Scoring** | Two-tier: dict lookup + live inference | O(1) for known domains (<1ms); graceful fallback for long-tail domains (~10ms with caching) |
| **Score Decay** | Exponential decay (e^−λt) | Smooth, continuous; category-specific half-lives; computed lazily at read-time (no batch job) |
| **Data Format** | Parquet (Apache Arrow) | Columnar, compressed, fast I/O -- industry standard for ML pipelines |
| **Serialization** | Pickle (cross-notebook artifacts) | Notebook-to-notebook dependency management; at scale, replace with MLflow/W&B |

**For production deployment**, replace the local equivalents with:
- **Domain lookup store:** Redis / Aerospike (~120MB, fits in memory on every bid node)
- **User score store:** Redis Cluster / Aerospike (~300GB compressed for 500M users)
- **Stream processing:** Kafka (partitioned by user_id) → custom bid processor
- **Segment export:** DynamoDB (real-time) + S3 (batch partner feeds)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd "NLP IAB Real-Time Audience Classification Pipeline"

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy matplotlib seaborn xgboost pyarrow jupyter ipykernel

# Run the notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/IAB_bidstream_user_classification.ipynb
```

Run all cells top to bottom. The notebook is self-contained -- no external dependencies beyond the installed packages.

### From Foundation to Production

This pipeline is designed as a **foundation that can be extended into a production system**. The core algorithms and architecture remain the same -- what changes is the data source and infrastructure:

| This Repo (Foundation) | Production Extension |
|---|---|
| Synthetic 500-domain corpus with generated text | Web crawler output (Scrapy) for 200K+ real domains |
| `domain_df.parquet` loaded from disk | Crawl pipeline → S3 → training pipeline (Airflow/Dagster) |
| In-memory Python dict for domain lookup | Redis/Aerospike cluster replicated to all bid nodes |
| Simulated 10K bidstream events | Kafka stream of 50B+ daily OpenRTB bid requests |
| Pickle artifacts | MLflow model registry with versioning and A/B deployment |

The core algorithms -- TF-IDF pipeline, model training, calibration, two-tier scoring logic, decay math, and segment generation -- carry over directly and form the foundation for the production system.

---

## Real-World Scale Context

The architecture in this repo was designed for the following real-world constraints. These numbers provide context for why each design decision was made:

### Scale Numbers

| Dimension | Volume | Latency Budget |
|---|---|---|
| Bid requests / day | 50 Billion | <100ms total (OpenRTB deadline) |
| Bid requests / second | 580K sustained, 2M+ peak | ~10ms for audience enrichment |
| Unique users | 500M active, 2B total pool | <10ms user score lookup |
| Domain lookup table | 200K entries, ~120MB | <2ms (in-memory hash map) |
| User profile storage | ~300GB compressed (500M users) | Sub-10ms read/write |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **TF-IDF over BERT** -- 50x cheaper training/inference, only 2-3% accuracy gap, no GPU at bid time
2. **Pre-computed lookup over real-time inference** -- O(1) hash map lookup vs. 5-10ms model inference per request
3. **Curated 200K domains over crawl-everything** -- 85% bid volume coverage at 1/4 the cost with better quality control
4. **Per-event exponential decay over batch reduction** -- Smooth, category-specific, no nightly batch job sweeping 500M users
5. **Probability vectors over materialized segments** -- 3-8x less storage, 1 write per event (vs. 5-15), instant new segment activation
